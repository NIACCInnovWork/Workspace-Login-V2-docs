Utilitys
========

A handfull of utilites are provided for managing data between envs.  These 
utilities are intended to be run locally and are located within the 
`ws_login_scripts` module.

Given these are utilities intended to be operated by support individuals, they
do not have the best error handling and trust that the support personal can 
diagnose any issues that arise during running of the utility.
